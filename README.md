# Kill-Switch

Kill-Switch is an easy-to-use and incredibly simple Chrome extension. The plugin allows for users to close all unproductive tabs with a single click.

Users are allowed to set their own blacklist of sites that they deem unproductive, and all tabs including those URLs will automatically be closed if they hit the button.

Kill-Switch is currently considered complete and is available [on the Chrome Web Store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kill-switch/hbnifenjjcmfoafpkomomlnldlcddaec)
